NAME
    Mac::AppleScript::Glue - allows AppleScript to be written in Perl

SYNOPSIS
        use Mac::AppleScript::Glue;

        my $finder = new Mac::AppleScript::Glue::Application('Finder');

        $finder->insertion_location->open;

DESCRIPTION
    This module allows you to write Perl code in object-oriented syntax to
    control Mac applications. The module does not actually execute Apple
    Events, but actually translates Perl code to AppleScript code and causes
    it to be executed.

    [See the manpage for further details.]
